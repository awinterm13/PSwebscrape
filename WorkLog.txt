The Goal is to understand Web Scraping and Certificate logins enough to convince team to upgrage PS so I can automate Company XYZ File Downloads.

Day one: 

Downloaded VScode
Downloaded PS core for system and Raspi (which needed a forever long upgrade.)

    Raspi 
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade
        $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
        $ sudo sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list    
        $ sudo sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list 
        $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
        $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
        $ sudo rpi-update 

    Reboot

        $ sudo apt-get install libunwind8
        $ wget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.2/powershell-6.0.2-linux-arm32.tar.gz
        $ mkdir ~/powershell
        $ tar -xvf ./powershell-6.0.2-linux-arm32.tar.gz -C ~/powershell
        $ sudo ln -s ~/powershell/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
        $ sudo ln -s ~/powershell/pwsh /usr/local/bin/powershell
        $ powershell

Wrote out Wedscrape.ps1  ( spelling error ) Its a nice framework to start with however it doesnt function. 
Wrote ScrapeBirdImgsOffBing It works. Actually a few tweaks and this is URL agnostic and can download an infinate amount of imgs.


Day 2

    Created a SimpleEimail.ps1 - its not the most current method for sending an email.  Need to look into Mailkits.  But Had some fun with it. 
    Made a Daily Bird Picture email and am running it on the pi
    Made a Alex Boi Program in the same manner with inspirational quotes to keep him grinding. 

PSWebscrape

    Need to find a site that kinda matches the javascript call links and figure out how to DL them.  
        Possible that I might need to look at the COM object but will try invoke-Webrequest first 

    PfxCertificate login.  This looks super hopefull. 

        $pfxcert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Users\PowershellNoob\Documents\EP2.pfx
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $source -Certificate $pfxcert -OutFile $destination -MaximumRedirection 3 -Verbose;


Basicailly

        Get Cert from folder of certs
        Use cert to login  -store session var  
        use session var find files I need and DL them  
        Delete Session var

        Do file stuff on our system easy peasey

        No way to test this at home. So I think, come like... as close as you can. 
        take some code you'd like to test then ask Dave\Shannon if you can give it a try

        Run from Term server? Meh....  I wonder if PS 3.0 can do this.
        Maybe I can advocate for PS core. 



DAy 3

    I tried to figure out how to login to a website.  
    Looks like this changed for pwsh. Looks like its doable but in a different way. 
    Worked on it for a few hours and finally posted it to stackover flow as I didnt see any good posts on it.
