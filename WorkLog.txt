The Goal is to understand Web Scraping and Certificate logins enough to convince team to upgrage PS so I can automate Company XYZ File Downloads.

Day one: 

Downloaded VScode
Downloaded PS core for system and Raspi (which needed a forever long upgrade.)

    Raspi 
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade
        $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
        $ sudo sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list    
        $ sudo sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list 
        $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
        $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
        $ sudo rpi-update 

    Reboot

        $ sudo apt-get install libunwind8
        $ wget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.2/powershell-6.0.2-linux-arm32.tar.gz
        $ mkdir ~/powershell
        $ tar -xvf ./powershell-6.0.2-linux-arm32.tar.gz -C ~/powershell
        $ sudo ln -s ~/powershell/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
        $ sudo ln -s ~/powershell/pwsh /usr/local/bin/powershell
        $ powershell

Wrote out Wedscrape.ps1  ( spelling error ) Its a nice framework to start with however it doesnt function. 
Wrote ScrapeBirdImgsOffBing It works. Actually a few tweaks and this is URL agnostic and can download an infinate amount of imgs.
